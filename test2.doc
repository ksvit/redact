Moreover, legends have
stopped being created in the decline of this practical and
positive nineteenth century, even in Brittany, the
country of the fierce Breton goblins, or in Scotland, the land
of brownies and gnomes, or in Norway, the homeland of 
aesir, elves, sylphs and Valkyries, or even in 
Transylvania, where the setting of the Carpathians lends
itself so readily to all psychagogic evocations. It should
be noted, however, that Transylvania as a country is still
quite attached to the superstitions of long ago.
